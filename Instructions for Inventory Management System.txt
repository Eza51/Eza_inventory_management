Assalamuwalaikum Bhaia,

I hope this message finds you well.I am submitting my Inventory Management System as part of 
my assignment. This project involved creating a simple yet functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
system for managing products in an inventory, built using PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS.

How to Use the System:
Add a New Product:

Go to the following link to add a new product:
ex link:
http://localhost/Eza_inventory_management/index.html.

Fill in the product name, description, price, and quantity.
Click the "Add Product" button to save the new product.
View Products:

To view the list of products, visit:

ex link:
http://localhost/Eza_inventory_management/display.php.
You will see all the products displayed in a table with options to edit or delete each product.

Thank you bhaia,for your time and consideration. 
I look forward to your feedback and hope you find the system functional and well-structured.

Sincerely,
Nowshin Jerin Eza.
